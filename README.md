# SAKILA-Database-Driven-Website
Just a link to a screen capture of the database-driven website project we did in 2019. For this project, we used PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The reason that I could not upload the code here on Github is because it is a very old project that we did in 2019. I was using a different laptop and have now unfortunately lost all the files for this project (except this video which was in a USB). Will update this repo if I manage to retrieve those files again.
